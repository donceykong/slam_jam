# SLAM JAM

A toolbox for learning SLAM-related concepts. 

## Organization
The organization of this toolbox is still under construction, but the current idea is to first add modules to best understand
statistical optimization and regression. After that, we would like to add modules to help build factor graphs, likely from some actual data.

## Definitions

- **Error**: The error is the deviation of an observed value from an element of a statistical sample from it's **true** value

- **Residual**: The deviation of an observed value for an element of a statistical sample from its **estimated** value.
